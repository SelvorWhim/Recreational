So I wrote a poem that turned out a bit like a riddle and answer, pertinent to this repository, so I thought I'd pose it here. I've encoded the plaintext of the riddle and answer (in poem form) as well as the answers accepted as guesses so they don't appear as plaintext literals in the code. It's simply character-by-character ASCII codes - hardly encryption, but the point is not to make the answer inaccessible - you have the option to skip the guesses at any point - just to give you a moment to consider the question and guess if you like, and to make the text less easily web scraped.

The specific riddle might be a bit obvious in context, but I'll make the code around it reusable for different ones too.

To display the riddle/answer, run the riddler.py script with Python (haven't checked if it's compatible with Python 2, but 3 should definitely work). For the given riddle riddler.py is standalone for now.
