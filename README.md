# Recreational

I'm starting this repository as a place for scripts and small code projects made in answer to challenges more internal than the competitive repository, but still too short to be standalone projects. I have plans to include code challenges I post on challenge websites, random visualizations made using code, and poetry relating to code in some roundabout way.
